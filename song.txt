[Intro]
And I don't know what you're gonna do
Don't know about me
One, two, three, let's go

[Verse 1]
Tell me when you want me too
So get around me

[Post-Verse]
So run for the gold, run for the money
Run for the infinity
We'll never return and be free
But every time that I come around
There's too many little things they know about us
No, I can't play

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be your friend, babe
There's no other way
I'm the one so baby don't pretend
And I don't wanna make it bad so
There's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad

[Chorus]
Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over. Tight
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over. Tight
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water
[Verse 2]
Then we fall in the replay
For the night calling
Where princes rule the world
The party ain't jumping
But we should get lost before you

[Post-Verse]
So run for the gold, run for the money
Run for the infinity
We'll never return and be free
But every time that I come around
There's too many little things they know about us
No, I can't play

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be your friend, babe
There's no other way
I'm the one so baby don't pretend
And I don't wanna make it bad so
There's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad
